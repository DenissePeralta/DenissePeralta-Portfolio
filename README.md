## About me
---
I’m a woman passionate about dancing, music and travel. I'm curious to search, explore and learn new things. I see myself as a decisive person who always seeks to translate ideas into concrete actions, I resort to empathy to understand people needs and I rely on congruence to align what I think with what I say and do. I studied the bachelor in Business Administration with experience in the Financial area but now I’m discovering a big interest in graphic design, programming and technology.

I have the goal to get involve in social activities aimed to fight for the well-being and development of the communities and ecosystems around me, so I love the idea of ​​being able to create innovative web products and incredible applications to provide a digital solution to some of the challenges lived day by day in the society.
